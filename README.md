Built movie recommendation system based on three different collaborative filtering algorithms： slope one algorithm, user based collaborative filtering algorithm, item based collaborative filtering algorithm.

 the movie data set is from MovieLens dataset. MovieLens dataset is collected by GroupLens Research from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. It includes scores that users rate movies. The one I use includes around 700 users, 9000 movies, 100000 rating records.
